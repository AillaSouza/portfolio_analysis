# Portfolio Analysis Project

Welcome to the Portfolio Analysis Project! This project is designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis of a set of financial assets. Over multiple days, you'll explore different aspects of financial analytics, employing Python to analyze, visualize, and optimize a sample portfolio. Whether you’re a student or a professional looking to advance your financial analysis skills, this project will provide a practical and structured approach.

# Project Overview

In this project, you'll perform tasks commonly faced in real-world finance, including:

- Loading and cleaning financial data
- Visualizing asset prices and returns
- Calculating historical returns and risk
- Analyzing and constructing a portfolio with optimal weights
- Evaluating portfolio performance and risk metrics
- Through this hands-on approach, you’ll gain valuable insights into financial data analysis, advance your Python skills, and strengthen your understanding of financial principles.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into various stages, each representing a different analytical task. Here’s a breakdown of the project files included in this repository:

- 'portfolio_analysis.ipynb': The main Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step analysis and code for each task.
- 'asset_price_data.csv': Historical price data of the assets in the portfolio.
- 'asset_information_data.csv': Metadata about each asset, including asset classes and other relevant details.
- 'portfolio_weights.csv': The initial allocation weights for each asset in the portfolio.

# Project Workflow

The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the provided asset data and explore initial patterns.
Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Data Visualization
Visualize the historical price data.
Create comparison charts for asset returns.
3. Calculating Returns
Compute daily and cumulative returns for each asset.
Analyze historical return performance.
4. Portfolio Analysis
Calculate the portfolio's overall return and risk using the asset weights.
Optimize the portfolio using metrics like Sharpe Ratio and minimum variance.
5. Advanced Analysis
Conduct additional analyses, such as risk analysis and sensitivity testing on weights.
